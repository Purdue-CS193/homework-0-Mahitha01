# Mahitha's First CS193 Homework

- I like that CS193 is a course to introduce us to the tools we can use throughout our time studying and learning CS.
- It also helps us use these tools in the future when we are in the workforce.
- It's great that students are the ones leading this course because who else would know which resources are helpful than them.
- We get to be in contact with upperclassmen.
